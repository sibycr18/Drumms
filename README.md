Drumms is a web application that allows users to play virtual drums using their keyboard or by clicking on drum tiles. Each drum tile represents a different drum sound and is mapped to a specific keyboard letter. The app supports playing multiple sounds simultaneously, providing a realistic drumming experience.

## Features

- Play drums by clicking on the drum tiles or pressing the corresponding keys on your keyboard.
- Simultaneously play multiple drum sounds when multiple keys are pressed together.
- Customize the visual feedback for tile clicks or key presses.
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on different devices.
- Fine-tune the volume control for an optimal audio experience.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Provides the structure and layout of the webpage.
- CSS: Handles the visual styling and responsiveness of the app.
- JavaScript: Implements the drum interaction, key mappings, and audio playback.
- Audio files: Sound samples in an appropriate format (e.g., WAV, MP3).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Drumms.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    cd Drumms

3. Open the index.html file in your web browser.

4. Click on the drum tiles or press the corresponding keys on your keyboard to play the drum sounds.

## Customization
